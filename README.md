### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a student at BloomTech Institute, studying Full Stack Web Developement. One other thing about me is that I also work with computer hardware, and am able to diagnose and repair computers. I wanted to learn more about how computers work other than hardware related things, so I joined BloomTech!
